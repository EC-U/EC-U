    Archaeological City contains the remains of an iconic Islamic city that during most of the 9th century CE served as the capital of the Abbasid Empire that extended from Tunisia to Central Asia. Located on both banks of the River Tigris 130 km north of Baghdad, the site testifies to the architectural and artistic innovations that developed there before spreading through the Islamic world and beyond. The 9th-century Great Mosque and its spiral minaret are among the numerous remarkable architectural monuments of this exceptionally large archaeological site (41.5 by 4 to 8km). Eighty percent of the site remains to be excavated
